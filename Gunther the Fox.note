An old Markish soldier who was too weak to be accepted as a Ripper. Out of spite, he killed the officials who refused him in their sleep. He then fled to Demareilles, eventually ending up in the Souterrain as part of the Rats des Marais. He doesn't much care for ideals or moral. He just enjoys a good power trip. He can be hired for not too much money, as long as he deems the job to be fun.

His brother Berold is currently kept as a fighting slave by Hector the Vulture. As soon as Gunther manages to free Berold, he plans to be out of here and travel wherever his whim takes him.
