Dûr'Randir has awoken, and so have his old allies. A stunning number of Orcs, Chuuls, Kuo-Toa and Merrow in the West have noticed his return and have been given a chance to redeem themselves for their inactivity over the past months. The city of Port Karina is now under siege by a horde of vile monsters of the sea.

The siege must be stopped, and the Grey Ones must be prevented from multiplying before their presence cascades into an unstoppable horde of undead.
