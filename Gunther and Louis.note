Louis Lourant has hired Gunther the Fox to escort him to the entrance of the Imperium Compound. Due to the miasma, Gunther refused to go further. Right at the entrance, a bunch of Hell Hounds ambushed the pair. Louis went further inside while Gunther managed to escape. The Hounds stole the Imperium Pin and brought it to Hector the Vulture.
