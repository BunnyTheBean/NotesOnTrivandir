The Essential Theory of Divinity was developed as part of the Imperium Project and seeks to explain the nature of divinity itself. It served as the theoretical foundation in the creation of Meyram's Star - a weapon capable of banishing a minor deity from an entire plane of existence.

According to this theory, a god's existence is strongly bound to one more planes of existence. To exist and to thrive, a god must bind itself to a plane, intertwining with the very reality of it. This connection manifests in a variety of ways:
- divine power granted to a deity's followers
- the power of certain ideas and thoughts increasing (e.g. peace with Frig, war with Animos)
- strong gods can even directly shape the world itself

When a god-like being is worshipped, its existence is bound closer to this world. The idea of its - its very essence - begins to intertwine with physical reality and the reality of mortals. This is also a tentative explanation for the creation of the divine as the result of mortal belief, although this hypothesis is far from proven.

The conclusion that the Imperium Project drew from this theory is that a god can effectively be banished from a plane of existence by severing this connection. If a deity were to manifest itself in a strong enough material form - an avatar - this avatar would form the nexus of a deity's connection to a plane. By concentrating a majority of a god's essence in one place, it would be a perfect focus for severing the deity - all of its power and ideas - from the current world.
