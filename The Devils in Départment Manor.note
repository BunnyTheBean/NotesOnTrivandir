The Riesmarkish Department for Subversive Actions - a.k.a. the Department of Terror - has made a contract with Fierna- the most charming and manipulative of Archdevils. The Markish promise to give the souls of their prisoners of war to Fierna, who is free to coerce and beguile these poor wretched mortals into terrible contracts. In return, Fierna's subordinates infiltrate the Marisian upper class. The goal is to weaken the Marisian government and ultimately control even King Florence himself.

The DÃ©partment family is one of the devils' victims. Annabelle and Matthieu have both been imprisoned beneath the mansion, along with a great number of servants. The devil Seyezu - an Erinyes - has taken on the appearance of Annabelle and rules the family in her stead. As part of the contract, any important persons - such Annabelle, Matthieu, and any higher servants - are not to be killed, but only interrogated. This information is to serve the Markish war effort.
